# rockpaperscissors-js-practice

Small project for practicing basic Javascript skills,
list of skills used listed below:

Use of for loops, invoking functions, variables, small use of arrays, setting parameters for functions, using if/else if/else statements, using .random for computer choices in rock-paper-scissors

Overall this project was decently challenging as I felt thrown into Javascript without much direction. I struggled heavily with trying to get the loop to invoke the playRound function, which was essential to actually making the game work.

The biggest takeaway from this project is understanding how to write clean code, as my own sloppiness is what hindered me, and understanding the logic of coding. I.E. I would try and create an if statement that compared to values but due to coding errors, one of the variables it was comparing would be blank and therefore would not run; completely breaking the if statement.

Used javascript and DOM manipulation methods to add a UI
to the rock paper scissors project. A very simple UI was created using buttons and event listeners for those buttons. A better UI can be created given the framework of the javascript code, as the buttons can be updated to an imagine/animations can be used with the same "baseline" code. Overall this portion of the project was challenging as DOM methods were confusing at first. When first learning about the DOM I was unsure why anyone would ever use it, because the examples/practice I had with DOM manipulation was just adding headers/new text divs. Now I understand the DOM exists to create interaction between HTML and javascript files so that one can essentially write code to inact a function and have that code be "activated" by HTML and translate the result of that code into HTML itself. This explanation is pretty rudimentary, and does not fully grapse the explanation I am trying to give, but does a just enough job in a small README file attached to a simple project.
