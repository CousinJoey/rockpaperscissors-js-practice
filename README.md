# rockpaperscissors-js-practice

Small project for practicing basic Javascript skills,
list of skills used listed below:

Use of for loops, invoking functions, variables, small use of arrays, setting parameters for functions, using if/else if/else statements, using .random for computer choices in rock-paper-scissors

Overall this project was decently challenging as I felt thrown into Javascript without much direction. I struggled heavily with trying to get the loop to invoke the playRound function, which was essential to actually making the game work.

The biggest takeaway from this project is understanding how to write clean code, as my own sloppiness is what hindered me, and understanding the logic of coding. I.E. I would try and create an if statement that compared to values but due to coding errors, one of the variables it was comparing would be blank and therefore would not run; completely breaking the if statement.
